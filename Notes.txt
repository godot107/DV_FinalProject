	google search: DUI data sets


It looks a lot of the data sets are organized by country so we can make our own data sets if we have to from what we have here. 
Because that there's a lot of data sets I think we need to be familiar in terms of formatting our data sources

can probably remake the same graphs from:
http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/by_the_numbers/drunk_driving/index.html

since they give CSV for it

I think if we are stump, we could always look at other people and see what they did.

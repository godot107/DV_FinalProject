These countries have a low percent of young drivers, regardless they employ a high if not all amount of punishments for being caught driving under the influence

I thought maybe that having a high percent of young drivers a country would be more strict in the amount of punishments for a DUI. Our data did not support this however.
Even though these countries had a lot of young drivers on the streets it did not affect the amount of punishments they'd administer.
